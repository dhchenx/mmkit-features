# MMKit-Features Documents

This section presents a summary of usage of the features used in the `MMKit-Features` Python library. 

To handle the extraction of various multimodal features such as text, image, speech, and video, different modules are utilized. Furthermore, the toolkit enables the quick and simple fusion and storage of the extracted features.

## Applications

Here are some examples of using our work in real life with codes and documents. 

### 1. Multimodal Features Extractors

- [Text Features Extraction](text_features_extraction.md)
- [Speech Features Extraction](speech_features_extraction.md)
- [Image Features Extractoin](image_features_extraction.md)
- [Video Features Extraction](video_features_extraction.md)
- [Transformer-based Features Extraction](../src/mmkfeatures/transformer/README.md)

### 2. Multimodal Feature Library (MMFLib)

- [Basic Computational Sequence](simple_computational_seq_use.md)
- [Core use of MMFLib](multimodal_features_library.md)

### 3. Multimodal Knowledge Bases

- [Multimodal Birds Feature Library](example_bird_library.md)
- [Multimodal Disease Coding Feature Library](example_icd11_library.md)
- [Multimodal ROCO Feature Library](../examples/roco_lib/step1_create_lib_roco.py)

### 4. Multimodal Indexing and Querying

- [Brute Force Indexing](../examples/birds_features_lib/step3_use_index.py)
- [Inverted Indexing](../examples/birds_features_lib/step3_use_index.py)
- [Positional Indexing](examples/birds_features_lib/step3_use_index.py)
