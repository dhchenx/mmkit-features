# MMKit-Features Documents

This section presents a summary of usage of the features used in the MMKit-Features Python library. 

There are several modules used to implement different functions to cope with multimodal features extraction, namely text, image, speech, and video features. Moreover, the toolkit allows us to fuse and store the extracted multimodal features in a rapid and easy manner.
