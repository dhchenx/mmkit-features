## Transformer-based Feature Extraction

We also integrate the state-of-the-art Transformer-based methods to extract features based on a series of large-scale pretrained models. 

### Examples

1. Text-based Transformer-based feature extraction using [Transformer-XL](https://huggingface.co/transfo-xl-wt103). 

2. Image-based Transformer-based feature extraction based on [Swin Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer). 

More implementaion of Transformer-based extractors are coming soon.
